# DOMBuilder

DOMBuilder is a tiny JavaScript/CoffeeScript class for generating DOM nodes on the fly.

For a more detailed description of DOMBuilder, see the [documentation](http://skyzyx.github.com/dombuilder/) or [view the source](http://github.com/skyzyx/dombuilder/).

## Tests

DOMBuilder leverages the [QUnit](https://github.com/jquery/qunit) unit testing framework. You can run the tests by opening `tests/test-runner.html` in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can [run the tests for the lates release](http://skyzyx.github.com/dombuilder/tests/test-runner.html).

## Inspiration

[DOMBrew](https://github.com/glebm/DOMBrew/) (for CoffeeScript) was originally inspired by DOMBuilder 1.2. DOMBrew added some awesome new features, so DOMBuilder 1.3 added a number of matching features.

## CoffeeScript Port

The CoffeeScript port was generated from the JavaScript source using [JS 2 Coffee](http://js2coffee.org).
