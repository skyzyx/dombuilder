# DOMBuilder

DOMBuilder is a tiny class for generating DOM nodes on the fly.

## Documentation

See the [documentation](http://skyzyx.github.com/dombuilder/) or [view the source](http://github.com/skyzyx/dombuilder/).

## Inspiration

[DOMBrew](https://github.com/glebm/DOMBrew/) (for CoffeeScript) was originally inspired by DOMBuilder 1.2. DOMBrew added some awesome new features, so DOMBuilder 1.3 added a number of matching features.
