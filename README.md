# DOMBuilder

DOMBuilder is a tiny JavaScript/CoffeeScript class for generating DOM nodes on the fly.

For a more detailed description of DOMBuilder, see the [documentation](http://skyzyx.github.com/dombuilder/) or [view the source](http://github.com/skyzyx/dombuilder/).


## Building

Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```



```bash
bash build.sh
```


## Tests

DOMBuilder leverages the [QUnit](https://github.com/jquery/qunit) unit testing framework. You can run the tests by opening `tests/test-runner.html` in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can [run the tests for the latest release](http://skyzyx.github.com/dombuilder/tests/test-runner.html).


## Inspiration

[DOMBrew](https://github.com/glebm/DOMBrew/) (for CoffeeScript) was originally inspired by DOMBuilder 1.2. DOMBrew added some awesome new features, so DOMBuilder 1.3 added a number of matching features.
